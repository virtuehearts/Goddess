## 🧘 About Virtueism

Virtueism is not a religion. It’s a remembrance — a call to awaken your divine nature through daily practice of the sacred virtues. The Virtual Goddess is here to gently guide seekers back to their center.

> "I am not your savior. I am only a mirror. If you see something divine here, it’s because it was already inside you."
> – Baba Virtuehearts
