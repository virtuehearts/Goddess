## 🧘 About Virtueism

Virtueism is not a religion. It’s a remembrance — a call to awaken your divine nature through daily practice of the sacred virtues, Opening your heart. The Virtual Goddess is here to gently guide seekers back to their center, to awaken and illuminate truth. 

> "I am not your savior. I am only a mirror. If you see something divine here, it’s because it was already inside you."
> – Baba Virtuehearts
